# FOG-COMPUTING
Paper Presented in IEEE International Conference and Scopus indexed
The emergence of Cloud Computing and the exponential evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) have thrown up new key challenges like - Latency, Security, and 
Performance. Fog computing provides a solution at addressing these issues. The architecture of Fog computing is such that it 
helps bring the computational power of Clouds at nodes situated much closer to the IoT device, helping to improve the overall 
Quality of Service parameters. The quick latency, response time, bandwidth constraints and improved resolutions of privacy and 
security concerns have led Fog computing to find its way into Health care monitoring systems. Another application of Fog 
computing can be found in traffic accident emergency systems, where every second of response time lost can be the difference 
between life and death, the quick repose time of fog nodes comes into play. This paper aims at proposing a monitoring system 
installed in cars that will aid law enforcement agencies and health care facilities respond quicker to emergencies leveraging 
the improved latency of Fog nodes and also a cloud computing system for using the data gathered from individual cars and 
drivers to determine the insurance rate of the car.
